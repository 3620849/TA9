userpage generate clientId and collect all info about client and send it to server with status ONLINE
this information will be stored in local memory and after server define current time and set it inside client-entity
there is scheduled task which check all entities and check how long ago entity refreshed if entity doesn't updated last 4second entity will be marked as OFFLINE

because current git repository already contains compiled jar files and angular dist folders there is no need build tools like:maven,nodejs or jdk

because angular application runs at nginx in docker container and port 80 is exposed
no need to specify port at browser
